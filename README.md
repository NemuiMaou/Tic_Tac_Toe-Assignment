For this assignment, mainly running through the comments and implementing the changes to my code wasn't too difficult. I had trouble getting the board to appear for the longest time until I realized that I needed to call the initHolder on the grid itself. From there and writing the rest of the assignment was pretty straight forward, I found it enjoyable looking through the code that was given and piecing it together to get the tic tac toe game to run and work. All of the code was written in Visual Studio.

The AI for this game was implemented with negamax using alpha-beta pruning. To write this code, I followed along the live coding in class while going through implementing the AI for this game.
